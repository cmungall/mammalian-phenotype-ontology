We have deprecated the berkleybop server process. If you are currently getting the MP file directly from berkleybop, please switch to using the purl (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mp.obo and  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mp.owl) or getting the files directly from the MGI ftp site (http://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html#pheno).
