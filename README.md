# Source for Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
![Build Status](https://github.com/obophenotype/mammalian-phenotype-ontology/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## MP build pipeline

The MP build pipeline now uses GitHub actions.

We have deprecated the Jenkins server process. If you are currently getting the MP file directly obofoundry pipeline, please switch to using the purl (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mp.obo and  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mp.owl) or getting the files directly from the MGI ftp site (http://www.informatics.jax.org/downloads/reports/index.html#pheno).

The OBO formatted file, mp.obo, on the MGI site is renamed to MPheno_OBO.ontology. 

The retired Jenkins urls will soon be inactive
